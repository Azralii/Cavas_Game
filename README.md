Visual Studio Code
Git (Github)
The Unix terminal
Local Storage

## Understanding and Skills Developed:
Structure programs according to the object-oriented paradigm
Be able to search and use documentation resources to resolve issues that arise during development
Implement real-time communication in web applications
Transform sketches into digital prototypes and functional user interfaces

## Programming Languages and Frameworks:
HTML
CSS
JavaScript
Canvas
Node.js

## Description
The module focuses on understanding and using WebSockets for real-time communication, a two-way communication between clients and a server. You will learn how to establish a connection and what a chat application can look like. In the module there is a focus on object-oriented programming in JavaScript and creating graphics and animation in canvas elements. See how data can be stored in the browser via Local Storage and how cookies are used for, for example, a user of an application to approve the storage of data in accordance with the current data storage directive.
